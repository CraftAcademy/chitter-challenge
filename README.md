#Notes on Test Coverage Reporting

Please ensure you have the following **AT THE TOP** of your spec_helper.rb in order to have test coverage stats generated on your pull request:

```ruby
require 'coveralls'
require 'simplecov'

SimpleCov.formatters = [
  SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter,
  Coveralls::SimpleCov::Formatter
]
Coveralls.wear! 
```

Note that you can replace `Coveralls.wear!` with  `SimpleCov.start` to get coverage stats locally
Then run `open coverage/index.html` from the command line to view details


#TODO
* Update this README to indicate the technologies used and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.
* Submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.

#Bonus User Story

In order to start a conversation as a Chitter I want to reply to a Chit from another Chitter.

#Bonus CSS

Note that you can replace `Coveralls.wear!` with  `SimpleCov.start` to get coverage stats locally
